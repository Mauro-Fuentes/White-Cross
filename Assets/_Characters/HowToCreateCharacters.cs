	/// 
	/* 
	Create a new character fallowing these:

	1. Once Character.cs is on a character mesh, the Character.cs Class will invoke everything for you

	2. The animator controller is a dummy, but you have to use it.
	3. What you really need is a controller override.
	be careful, the override takes animations and also a controller, if you do not provide one, the main character controller
	will take its place and your enermies will end up mimicking your main character.
	
	4. Select animations in the override.

	5.
